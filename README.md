# Socials
Making my first website for my social media accounts. This will be a mockup version that can be displayed publicly here on Github for my professional portfolio while the actual version will be kept separate so as to maintain confidentiality. The idea for this project will be to create three webages. The home page will be a simple landing page that makes it easier for people to view and move between various social accounts. The second page will act as a live media kit for brands that updates data regularly. The third page will serve as a past/future projects blog posting page.
